### 🛠️ Projects I Built During for organizations solving problems within the organization

During my IT, I focused on solving real problems in the company using Python and basic automation tools. Some of the projects I developed include:


#### 🔹 **1. Digital Form System (Data Collection Automation)**
I created a simple digital form that helped the company replace manual paper forms.  
This made data collection faster, reduced errors, and improved how information was stored.

#### 🔹 **2. Attendance Tracking System**
I designed an automated attendance system to make staff check-ins and data recording easier.  
It removed the need for manual entry and made staff attendance more organized and accessible. 

These solutions made daily tasks easier for the staff and increased productivity.
